I wasn’t supposed to use Steve or Jo or anyone else in the film as a model Asian-American. I was to share the characters’ journeys and follow them through their confusion, their discoveries, their chase after Chan Hung. And like most meaningful questions — or “appropriately Chinese” ones as Jo says — Chan is never found. We are left with remnants, memories, blurry photographs, his jacket, his cookies, his dialogues. Wang has done something I’ve never seen any film do: build a journey for the Asian-American viewer. It is not simply representation."
